#ExpertSystem
============

a Simple Expert System Called " Atrophy Diagnosis System"  i did when i was a student, i also made it in Python &amp; PyQT, just to discover the language, though it is not my primary language.

## How it works?
you can open termain and just run 
 ```bash
 python Main.py
 ```

## Bugs ?
yes, there are a few bugs exists, but the app still functional.

## Continious Development ?
No, not really, that was a college easy project, and i just wanted to discover python and PyQT, I am not planning to do any imporvments, though if you want to fix any bugs, feel free to fork it and push your solution :).
